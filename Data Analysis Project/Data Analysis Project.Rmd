There are 23 columns and 72,971 rows. This data represents all of the independent expenditure spending by candidates/committees from 2023-2024. The sheer amount of data might be limiting because there could be errors in the data. It also accounts for all types of races, so to compare certain types of expenditures would require a lot of filtering. Our questions might be hard to answer in terms of finding average spending because of the amount of data. Additionally, comparing geographical spending compared to other years will be hard because the dataset lacks geographical information.

Question 1: Which presidential candidates have spent the most during their campaign? Who has spent the least?

ANSWER: Jon Tester has the most, eight candidates are tied for the least.

```{r}
cleaned_expenditures |>
  group_by(candidate_name) |>
  summarise(total = sum(expenditure_amount, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(total))
```

Question 2: What are the most common payment purposes for payment in federal campaign finance data? What is the average amount paid per transaction for these top purposes?

ANSWER: 

Phonebanking -> average amount $980.15
Production Costs -> average amount $177,963.6
Media Production -> average amount $9263.04
Advertisement Management Services -> average amount $928.37
Canvassing -> average amount $65,250.19

```{r}
top_purposes <- cleaned_expenditures |>
  filter(!is.na(purpose), purpose != "") |>
  group_by(purpose) |>
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    average_amount = mean(expenditure_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_amount = sum(expenditure_amount, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count)) |>
  slice_head(n = 10)

top_purposes
```

Question 3: Which candidates receive the most independent support versus opposition, and how does spending differ between supporting and attacking candidates?

ANSWER: Jon Tester received the most independent support versus opposition. Democrats tend to spend more money on elections and their campaigns compared to Republicans.

```{r}
summary <- cleaned_expenditures |>
  filter(!is.na(candidate_name), support_or_oppose %in% c("S", "O")) |>
  group_by(candidate_name, support_or_oppose) |>
  summarise(total_spent = sum(expenditure_amount, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

top_supported <- summary |>
  filter(support_or_oppose == "S")|>
  arrange(desc(total_spent)) |>
  head(5)

top_opposed <- summary |>
  filter(support_or_oppose == "O") |>
  arrange(desc(total_spent)) |>
  head(5)

purpose_comparison <- cleaned_expenditures |>
  filter(!is.na(purpose), support_or_oppose %in% c("S", "O")) |>
  group_by(candidate_name, support_or_oppose) |>
  summarise(total_spent = sum(expenditure_amount, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(desc(total_spent))

  select(spender_name) |>
  distinct()

common_spenders <- inner_join(spenders_2020, spenders_2024, by = "spender_name")
