For these 10 blocks of code, we counted the number of times each "importance" answer was answered for each question. For example, Q2_10 corresponds to the original question of "How important do you think protesting if you believe government actions are wrong is to being a good American?" The numbers 1-4 correspond to importance, with 1 being very important, 2 being somewhat important, 3 being not so important and 4 being not at all important. So for CQ_10, the number 1854 means that 1854 people responded "very important" to "How important do you think protesting if you believe government actions are wrong is to being a good American?" This is the same logic for every single row in every single one of these code blocks.
